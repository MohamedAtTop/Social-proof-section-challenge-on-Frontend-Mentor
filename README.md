## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I can put more than one value in background-image and background-position to put more than one image and position it and here how I used It.

```css
body {
  background-image: url(image place), url(image place);
  background-position: The place of your first "background", The place of your
      second "background";
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me for background-position and that helped me to know that you can put two positions for two backgrounds.
